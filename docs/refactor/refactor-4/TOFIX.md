## Resolved Items

- [x] **Palette mismatch - gray VS Code-like vs navy tokens** — *`src/App.axaml`*
      The current palette (`#1E1E1E`, `#252526`, `#181818`, `#0E6AEB`, `#5B94F5`) was gray VS Code-like, not the navy tokens documented in DESIGN.md §7.
      Fix: M0.5-A - Replaced all 12 palette colors with DESIGN.md §7 navy values (`SurfaceBaseBrush=#0A0F19`, `PrimaryAccentBrush=#066ADB`, etc.)

- [x] **Missing Spacing/Radius tokens** — *`src/App.axaml`*
      Only color brushes existed; no `Spacing*` or `Radius*` resource keys documented in Refactor 3 M0.5.
      Fix: M0.5-B - Added 7 spacing tokens (`SpacingXxs`, `SpacingXs`, `SpacingSm`, `SpacingMd`, `SpacingLg`, `SpacingXl`, `SpacingXxl`) and 5 radius tokens (`RadiusSm`, `RadiusMd`, `RadiusLg`, `RadiusXl`, `RadiusFull`)

- [x] **M0 verification artifacts captured** — *`docs/refactor/refactor-4/verification/`*
      Baseline build log, test results, and both required screenshots (`m0-default.png`, `m0-min.png`) were captured. M0 verification is complete.

- [x] **Refactor 4 plan warning baseline drift** — *`docs/refactor/refactor-4/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`*
      The implementation plan now matches the captured M0 baseline (`0 Warning(s) / 0 Error(s)`), while preserving the `xUnit2013` fallback as a regression procedure if it reappears.

## Notes for Future Agents

- When adding a new item, follow this template:

  ```
  - [ ] **[brief title]** — *<file:line area>*
        What is wrong and why.
        Fix hint: ...
  ```

- Mark an item `[x]` and move it to **Resolved Items** with a one-line
  resolution summary when fixed.
- Do not delete items from **Resolved Items** — they form the audit
  trail for this refactor.
- If an item blocks a milestone, flag it in the PR description and
  link back to this file.
